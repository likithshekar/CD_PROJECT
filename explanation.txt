	10-min video max

	Grammar (Just show grammar and give basic explanation, for-loop and teritary operations(line 126 in Grammar) are used)
	Preprocessing and Symbol Table (Inside Output folder)
	Syntax Validity (run ./AST < input.c while uncommenting each error. When error doesn't affect code the code runs despite error, this is panic mode recovery, where it jumps to the next delimiter and continues exec)
	AST (run ./AST < input2.c as it's smaller and easier to explain, 'Dc b' means it's only declared and not initialized, use preorder to understand the tree)
	ICG (run ./ICG < input2.c don't run optimization code as it's pointless for this example)
	Assembly Code Generation (run python generate.py Output/icg.txt. Do this with input2.c not with input.c as theres a problem with goto
which comes in input.c)

P.S. remove the brackets when showing this file.
